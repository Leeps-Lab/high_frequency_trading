    <p><i>If you spot an error in these data, you must <b>now</b> contact the lab using the code <tt>{{ player.emergency_code }}</tt>: <a href="mailto:lab@example.com">lab@example.com</a>.</i></p>
    
    <p>If you have no further instructions, the experiment is now completed. You can now close the browser.</p>

    <p>Payment will be made within three working days. Please do not contact the laboratory until this deadline has passed. Quote the code <tt>{{ player.emergency_code }}</tt> in all queries. Without this code it is not possible to determine your payment amount.</p>

    <p>Using this payment form ensures that your behavioral data cannot be linked to your payment data. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
    
    <p><b>If you like, you can give us feedback on today's experiment.</b> Please make sure not to enter any personal data in this field.</p>
